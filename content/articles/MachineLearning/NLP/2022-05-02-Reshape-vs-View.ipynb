    "torch的view()与reshape()方法都可以用来重塑tensor的shape，区别就是使用的条件不一样。view()方法只适用于满足连续性条件的tensor，并且该操作不会开辟新的内存空间，只是产生了对原存储空间的一个新别称和引用，返回值是视图。而reshape()方法的返回值既可以是视图，也可以是副本，当满足连续性条件时返回view，否则返回副本[ 此时等价于先调用contiguous()方法在使用view() ]。因此当不确能否使用view时，可以使用reshape。如果只是想简单地重塑一个tensor的shape，那么就是用reshape，但是如果需要考虑内存的开销而且要确保重塑后的tensor与之前的tensor共享存储空间，那就使用view()。\n",
